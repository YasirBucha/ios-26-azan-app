# Audio Troubleshooting Guide

## Why Sound Works on Simulator but Not on iPhone Device

### Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was that the audio file `azan_notification.mp3` was not included in the app bundle, causing it to work only on the simulator (which has access to the development machine's file system) but fail on actual devices.

### Issues Fixed

1. **‚ùå Hardcoded File Path Issue**
   - **Problem**: AudioFileManager used hardcoded path `/Users/yb/Development/Azan/MyAzan/Assets/azan_notification.mp3`
   - **Solution**: Prioritize bundle resources over hardcoded paths
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

2. **‚ùå Notification Sound File Mismatch**
   - **Problem**: NotificationManager referenced `azan_notification.wav` but actual file is `azan_notification.mp3`
   - **Solution**: Updated to use correct `.mp3` extension
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

3. **‚ùå Audio Session Configuration**
   - **Problem**: Basic audio session setup without device-specific options
   - **Solution**: Enhanced with Bluetooth and mixing options for better device compatibility
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

4. **‚ùå Missing Bundle Resource**
   - **Problem**: Audio file not included in Xcode project bundle
   - **Solution**: Manual addition to Xcode project required
   - **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual step

### Required Manual Step

**Add Audio File to Xcode Project Bundle:**

1. Open Xcode project (already opened)
2. Right-click on 'MyAzan' folder in project navigator
3. Select 'Add Files to MyAzan...'
4. Navigate to and select: `MyAzan/Assets/azan_notification.mp3`
5. Ensure 'Add to target: MyAzan' is checked
6. Click 'Add'

**Alternative Method:**
1. Open Finder ‚Üí `/Users/yb/Development/Azan/MyAzan/Assets/`
2. Drag `azan_notification.mp3` into Xcode project navigator
3. Drop under MyAzan folder
4. Check 'Copy items if needed' and 'Add to target: MyAzan'
5. Click 'Finish'

### Verification Steps

After adding the file to the bundle:

1. **Build and Test**: Build the app and test on device
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for these success messages:
   - `‚úÖ Audio session configured successfully`
   - `‚úÖ Using bundle audio file: [path]`
   - `üéµ Audio player created and play() called - success: true`

3. **Test Both Methods**:
   - Manual "Test Azan" button in app
   - Scheduled prayer notifications

### Additional Debugging

If issues persist, check:

1. **Device Settings**:
   - Silent mode is OFF
   - Volume is UP
   - Do Not Disturb is OFF

2. **App Permissions**:
   - Notification permissions granted
   - Location permissions granted (for prayer times)

3. **Console Logs**: Look for error messages with ‚ùå emoji

### Code Changes Made

- **AudioFileManager.swift**: Fixed bundle resource loading
- **NotificationManager.swift**: Fixed sound file extension
- **AudioManager.swift**: Enhanced audio session and error logging

All changes maintain backward compatibility with simulator while fixing device issues.
