# Images for Custom UI Elements

Place your images in this folder with the following names:

## For Circular Container (Left side):
- `Mc.png` or `Mc.jpg` (for the circular container)

## For Rectangular Container (Right side):
- `MA.png` or `MA.jpg` (for the rectangular container)

Once you place the images here, run `./setup_images.sh` to copy them to the appropriate Xcode assets folders.
