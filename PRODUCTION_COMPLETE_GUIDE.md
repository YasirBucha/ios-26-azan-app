## üìù STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### **STEP 1: Fix Asset Catalog & Add App Icons** üé®

#### Option A: Quick Fix (Use Online Generator) - RECOMMENDED

1. **Create or find your app icon:**
   - Design a 1024x1024px icon featuring a mosque or crescent moon
   - Use your Liquid Glass mosque icon if available
   - Save as PNG

2. **Generate all sizes using online tool:**
   - Visit: https://appicon.co/ or https://makeappicon.com/
   - Upload your 1024x1024 icon
   - Download the generated icon set
   - Extract the ZIP file

3. **Replace placeholder icons:**
   ```bash
   cd MyAzan/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
   
   # Delete all placeholder PNG files
   rm -f *.png
   
   # Copy all generated icon files from downloaded ZIP
   # Files should be in the Downloads folder after extraction
   cp ~/Downloads/AppIcon.appiconset/*.png .
   ```

4. **Update Contents.json:**
   The appicon.co tool should generate this automatically. If not, you can manually add icons to the asset catalog in Xcode.

#### Option B: Manual Icon Creation (Advanced)

If you prefer to create icons manually:

1. **Create each size using design software (Photoshop/GIMP/Sketch):**
   - 1024x1024 (App Store)
   - 180x180 (iPhone @3x)
   - 120x120 (iPhone @2x)
   - 167x167 (iPad Pro)
   - 152x152 (iPad @2x)
   - 87x87 (Settings @3x)
   - 80x80 (Settings @2x)
   - 60x60 (Settings @3x)
   - 58x58 (Settings @2x)
   - 40x40 (Settings @2x/3x)

2. **Save files with exact names:**
   - `Icon-1024.png`
   - `Icon-60@3x.png` (180x180)
   - `Icon-60@2x.png` (120x120)
   - `Icon-83.5@2x.png` (167x167)
   - `Icon-76@2x.png` (152x152)
   - `Icon-29@3x.png` (87x87)
   - `Icon-40@3x.png` (120x120)
   - `Icon-40@2x.png` (80x80)
   - `Icon-20@3x.png` (60x60)
   - `Icon-20@2x.png` (40x40)

3. **Add to Xcode:**
   - Open Xcode
   - Select `MyAzan` target
   - Go to `Assets.xcassets` ‚Üí `AppIcon`
   - Drag each image to its corresponding slot
   - Xcode will validate sizes automatically

### **STEP 3: Add Azan Audio Files** üîä

- Replace with real recordings before App Store submission

#### 3.2 Audio File Requirements

**File Format:**
- **Format:** MP3 or M4A (preferred for iOS)
- **Bitrate:** 128kbps or higher

2. `azan_madinah.mp3` - Madinah Azan recording
3. `azan_cairo.mp3` - Cairo Azan recording

#### 3.4 Alternative: Add Audio Programmatically

If audio files are large, consider:
