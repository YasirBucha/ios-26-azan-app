## Development Notes

### Liquid Glass Implementation
The app uses iOS 26's new Liquid Glass APIs:

- `.background(.regularMaterial)` for more prominent glass
- Custom glass components with blur and depth

### Smart Update Frequency
Live Activities use intelligent update intervals:
- Every minute when <10 minutes remaining
- Every 5 minutes when 10-60 minutes remaining  
- Every 15 minutes when >60 minutes remaining

### Background Processing
- Daily prayer time recalculation at midnight
- Automatic notification rescheduling
- Minimal battery impact with efficient processing
